# McDonald-s-Menu-Nutritional-Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze the nutritional content of McDonald's menu items using data analysis techniques. By examining the calorie count and nutritional facts of various menu items, the analysis provides valuable insights into the health profile of McDonald's offerings.

Objective
The primary objectives of the analysis are:

Extract meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and trends of key nutrients. Identify healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content. Provide recommendations for improving the nutritional profile of menu items.

Methodology:
The analysis follows a structured approach, including the following steps:

Data Collection: Download the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset from [source link]. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering if necessary. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of calories and nutritional content across menu items. Explore trends and patterns in the dataset. Nutritional Analysis: Categorize menu items as healthy or less healthy based on predefined criteria. Identify correlations between different nutrients. Documentation and Reporting: Summarize findings, insights, and recommendations in a comprehensive report.
